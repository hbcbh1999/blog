I'm going on vacation in a couple weeks to Berlin and Amsterdam, flying to Berlin on August 12, leaving from Amsterdam on August 27, and transitioning between the two sometime in between.  Things `Emily <http://potteryblog.com>`_ and I should see or do?  Care to meet up?  On vacations my evenings tend to be underscheduled.
