I'm not saying this to anyone in particular, but I've heard people pronounce Django incorrectly *way* too often.  The "dj" in Django is a hard J, like in the word "jury" or "jolly".  You don't pronounce the D.

**Update**: Alex Limi tells me *I'm* wrong too, and it's a soft J, like... damn, I can't think of a word that uses a soft J in English.

I'm not sure I can use that pronunciation, I'm afraid I'll sound all Frenchy and weird.  I'll give it a go.  Zhango zhango zhango... hmm...

**Another update**: confirming my original pronunciation, Adrian says it *is* a hard J.  Alex is just too European for his own good.  Does the debate rage on?  Hopefully not.
