So, today is 9/11.  I almost missed it.  It's not like it catches you by surprise, you're not going to forget the date.  But it's just been slipping by for a few years now without much notice.

As an event it is still very *important*.  History flowed from that day.  But it doesn't mean anything anymore.

Remember how everyone was saying, on those days after 9/11/2001, that they thought about life differently, about the things that really mattered and the things that didn't?  A couple years ago I felt frustrated by how quickly that seemed to disappear, how quickly genuine sentiment turned into empty rhetoric.  A few years ago that transition was frustrating, now the whole thing seems laughable.  The death of irony?  No... after 9/11 our modern cynicism was down but it wasn't out.  It came back fighting, and a National Sense Of Grief was no match.

Whatever.  I'm tired of it anyway.  You win Whatever, you're the champ.
