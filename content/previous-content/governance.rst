It occurred to me... Django is something like a dictatorship... or maybe an `oligarchy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy>`_.  At first it seems like Pylons is the same... but no.  Pylons is clearly `feudal <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism>`_.  I lord over Paste, WebOb, FormEncode.  Mike Bayer lords over Mako and SQLAlchemy.  Ben lords over Routes, Beaker, and Pylons.

I suppose in all cases there is a certain amount of democracy, because there are no `serfs <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serf>`_, and any individual is free to travel to any kingdom they like.  Well, at least among the open source kingdoms.  Without citizenship, and with no exclusiveness of ownership, with even property having largely disappeared, I suppose it's inevitable that traditional metaphors of control and governance don't really make sense.
