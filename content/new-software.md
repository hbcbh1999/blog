Title: New Blog Software
Date: 2013-03-04

Since I want to start blogging again, of *course* I have to also change my software.  That's just out these things work.

And to start a new blog I need at least one post, otherwise things are breaky.  So of course the first post must be the announcement I am changing my software.

I hope that explains this post; it is not intended to actually be of interest to you, the reader.
